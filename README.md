# Generative deep features


## Team
Hila Manor and Da-El Klang  
Supervised by Tamar Rott-Shaham

## Notes:
Q1 - How to init noise for image? The color channels are correlated...
Q2 - It seems that the weights of the style loss is always 1.

## GIT TOKEN:
how to set token:
git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600'

## Insights
## 02/05/21
* **Image size matters**
  * ~~When alpha is high, we don't get squares~~
  * Probably the receptive field of the generator isn't big enough
  * Probably there are too little parameters
  * We achieved similar result w.r.t pixel-trained using CNN, and applying `alpha=0`
*  Rec Loss value is affected by image size! (needed alpha changes with image size)
* when introducting alpha, squares re-appear - with really big alpha we can get a reconstruction of the original image
  * But still get an original texture for random noise
  * When we made the alpha bigger (to get it to the same order of the style loss) the style loss also got bigger üòû
* ‚ùì Why is the noise in the first level fixed, not as stated in the paper?

It seems that high noise makes the fake image less grainy, but more blurry.
The the generator doesn't know how to generate small objects in the picture - maybe vgg min size issue?
